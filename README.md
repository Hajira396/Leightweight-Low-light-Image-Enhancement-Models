Trained files of top three models presented in the paper can be downloaded from the link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1o8o0tuc0aPnNq5NXNAjXcZfwOHu52d8U?usp=sharing

The required packages for running models are mentioned in "installations" file.

For the ease of model prediction for these models, soon the files for running on GPU and CPU both will be uploaded.
